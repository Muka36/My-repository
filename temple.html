                   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajaraja_I" target="_blank"> Rajaraja Chola,</a> who commissioned the temple, called it Rajarajeshwaram (Rajarājeśwaram), literally "the temple of the almighty of Rajaraja". A later inscription in the Brihannayaki shrine calls the temple's deity Periya Udaiya Nayanar, which appears to be the source of the modern names Brihadisvara and Peruvudaiyar Kovil.Brihadishwara (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration" target="_blank">IAST</a> Bṛihádīśvara) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit" target="_blank">Sanskrit</a> composite word composed of Brihat which means "big, great, lofty, vast",and Ishvara means "lord, Shiva, supreme being, supreme atman (soul)". The name means the "great lord, big Shiva" temple.

                <h2 id="location">Location</h2>
                <p>The Brihadeswara Temple is located in the city of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanjavur" target="_blank">Thanjavur,</a> about 350 kilometres (220 mi) southwest of Chennai. The city is connected daily to other major cities by the network of Indian Railways, Tamil Nadu bus services and the National Highways 67, 45C, 226 and 226 Extn. The nearest airport with regular services is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiruchirappalli_International_Airport" target="_blank"> Tiruchirappalli</a> International Airport (IATA: TRZ), about 55 kilometres (34 mi) away.
                    <p>

                The city and the temple though inland, are at the start of the Kaveri River delta, thus with access to the Bay of Bengal and through it to the Indian Ocean. Along with the temples, the Tamil people completed the first major irrigation network in the 11th century for agriculture, for movement of goods and to control the water flow through the urban center.

                <p>
                    A spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to develop from the fifth to the ninth century over the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalukya_dynasty" target="_blank"> Chalukya</a> era rule as evidenced in Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal, and then with the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_dynasty" target="_blank"> Pallava</a> era as witnessed at Mamallapuram and other monuments. Thereafter, between 850 and 1280 CE, Cholas emerged as the dominant dynasty. The early Chola period saw a greater emphasis on securing their geopolitical boundaries and less emphasis on architecture. In the tenth century, within the Chola empire emerged features such as the multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals. This, states George Michell, signaled the start of the new Chola style. This South Indian style is most fully realized both in scale and detail in the Brihadeshwara temple built between 1003 and 1010 by the Chola king Rajaraja I.

                    Douglas Barrett in his 1975 publication on Chola architecture states that a new style emerged between 866 and 940 CE starting with Vijayalaya, the first Chola ruler. According to Barrett, the Chola style did not develop out of the Pallava tradition. According to Gary J. Schwindler, Barrett's work supplies opinions that are "opportunities for endless conjecture and debate".
                    Thanjavur was a target of both Muslim and Hindu neighboring kingdoms, both near and far. The
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai_Sultanate" target="_blank"> Madurai</a> Sultanate was established in the 14th century, after the disastrous invasions and plunder of South India by Ala ud-Din Khalji's armies of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate" target="_blank"> Delhi Sultanate</a> led by Malik Kafur. Later Adil Shahi Sultanate, Qutb Shahis, Randaula Khan and others from east and west coasts of South India raided it, and some occupied it for a few years.<br>
                    In Tamil literature, the lord of dance form of Shiva, is referred to as Adavallan or Kuttaperumanadigal. This bronze style Nataraja from the Chola era is much celebrated and studied, including those of later texts such as Unmaivilakkam and Citampara Mummani Kovia describing its significance. Nataraja in Indian art dates to earlier pre-Chola centuries.
