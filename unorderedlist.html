                    <li>Potato</li>
                    <li>Oil</li>
                    <li>Cold water</li>

                    <li>Step 1:
Wash you potatoes well and cut them into medium-sized sticks. You can either use a knife or a French fry cutter. Make sure they’re of same size.</li>
<li>Step 2:
Next you have to soak the potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes. Make sure they are fully immersed. After half an hour, drain all the water from the potatoes. Spread them on paper towels to dry them completely.</li>
<li>Step 3:
Take a deep pot and pour 3 inches of vegetable oil in it. Heat it to 300° F. Add around ⅓ of the prepared potatoes and cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until they turn soft.
Do the same for all the remaining batches of potatoes.</li>
<li>Step 4:
Rise the heat to 400° F and put ⅓ of the fried potatoes back in the pot. Cook for 1-3 minutes or until they turn golden brown.</li>
<li>Step 5:
Line a dish with paper towels and spread the freshly cooked fries on them. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the fries. Then serve immediately.</li>
